  <h3><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Short Story:</span>
     <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf</span></h3>

  <hr style="border: 2px solid green;">

  <p>A <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: x-large;">shepherd</span> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. 
  He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>

  <p>One day while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grazing</span> the sheep, he shouted, 
  "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn’t find any wolf.</p>

  <p>The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". 
  <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: xx-large;">The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</span></p>

  <p>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, 
  suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. 
  The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! 
  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The wolf is carrying a lamb away!</span>"</p>

  <p><span style="color: purple; font-size:x-large;">The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing
  mischief again. </span>So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his help.</p>
