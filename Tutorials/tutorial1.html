<h1>Explain the advantages of using a database. - Tutorial 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Minimize and control data redundancies: Database uses normalization to reduce redundancies as well as duplicate data making it very efficient and easy to access, while also making it easy to understand the relationship between different tables.</li>
<li>Data manipulation: Using a database makes retrieving data very easy as it uses tools like primary keys and queries to filter and sort data. This allows for data  manipulation which can be used for analysis and data visualization.</li>
<li>Data Security and restriction of unauthorized access: The use of a database allows for security measures to be put in place such as authorization methods, as this is very common in database servers and cloud databases, preventing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data.</li>
<li>Concurrent access: The use of a database server allows multiple users to utilize a database. This means that large scale applications can process database queries and requests for many users across the globe.</li>
<li>Support multi-users views: the use of a database also allows many individuals to modify and use a database at the same time.</li>
<li>Data can be shared: Data can be easily shared through a database server as it can even be accessed remotely from anywhere.</li>
<li>Data abstraction: Databases allow the removal of redundant information and present in a simplified manner by only exposing relevant information.</li>
</ul>
